# A Unity cli tool for MacOs's Oh-My-Zsh Console

* This is a very **Scratchy** script, only tested for **my current mac**
* So there is no time to make a shorter title for this 'project'

# Useage

```bash
up 
```
open project in `./`
<br>
```bash
up path/to/unity/project
```
open project

**THAT'S ALL**
